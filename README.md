Handkit is an Elixir client for the [Handcash Connect API](https://handcash.io/developers/connect).

Handkit offers 100% coverage of the Handcash Connect APIs, so you can build
blazing fast Bitcoin apps with Elixir in hours.

Full documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/handkit](https://hexdocs.pm/handkit).

## Sponsor this project

Handkit is one of over 30 open source libraries and packages that Chronos Labs
lead developer [Libs](https://twitter.com/libitx) has released to make it easier
to build apps and products on Bitcoin.

Your sponsorship will help us continue to release and maintain the software that
Bitcoin businesses and developers depend on.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `handkit` to your list of dependencies
in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:handkit, "~> 0.2"}
  ]
end
```

You will need to register your application using the Handcash
[developer dashboard](https://dashboard.handcash.io) and make a note of your
app's **app ID**.

## User authorization

Familiarize yourself with the Handcash Connect
[user authorization flow](https://docs.handcash.io/docs/user-authentication-overview).

Within your Elixir app, use Handkit to generate a redirection URL and present
a button in your app's UI for users to click and grant your app's permissions.

```elixir
redirect_url = Handkit.get_redirection_url("123456789")
# => "https://app.handcash.io/#/authorizeApp?appId=123456789"
```

When a user grants your app's permissions, they will be redirected back to the
URL configured in the developer dashboard. You app must handle that request
and capture the `authToken` parameter. For example, a Phoenix action to
capture the `authToken` and store it in a session may look like this:

```elixir
def auth(conn, %{"authToken" => auth_token}) do
  conn
  |> put_session(:auth_token, auth_token)
  |> put_flash(:info, "Successfully authenticated with Handcash")
  |> redirect(to: "/app")
end
```

## Usage

Once a user is connected, the Handcash Connect APIs are interfaced with by
creating a `Connect Client` struct and passing that
to all subsequent API calls.

```elixir
# Create the client
iex> client = Handkit.create_connect_client(auth_token)
%Connect{}

# Get the full profile of the currently connected user
iex> Handkit.Profile.get_current_profile(client)
{:ok, %{
  "private_profile" => %{
    "email" => "StevenUrban1234@gmail.com",
    "phone_number" => "+11234567891"
  },
